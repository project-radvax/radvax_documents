# Taking RadVax
The docs here are basic instructions for how to take RadVax, written to be simple enough for anyone to understand.

If you have made RadVax and are distributing it to your friends and family, you can give them a bottle containing the vaccine, and one of the instruction sheets here.

The canonical version is the English-language version, "taking_RadVax_EN.md".  You can help the project by:
1. Extending the canonical version
2. Translating the document into your local langague
3. Making improvements either to the canonical or local versions.

If you do make changes or additions, just submit a Pull Request.  If you don't know how to do that, then email us and we'll try to get those changes incorporated.

Thanks!
